# Learn japanese app

The target of this app is to learn japanese in a fun way. The learning is completely self paced.
I have lots of features ideas, but if you want to propose new ones, feel free to contact me at ignacio.sanhueza.l@gmail.com. Some of this ideas are:

-   Learn more languages (not only japanese).
-   Create a teacher profile, to check if a student really practiced during the week.
-   Create custom tests or homework to send to students.
-   From all the words that users submit, create a base repository, to search words as a dictionary.
-   Add more languages using i18n

# Technology to use

The idea of this application is that is coded using ReactJs (w/Typescript) for the front, NodeJs & Express (w/Typescript) for the back and postgresql for the database. As soon as I start with the backend will link that project with this one.

## Usage

-   Download the repo
-   Run
    `npm install`
    `npm start`
