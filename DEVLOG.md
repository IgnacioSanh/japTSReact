First configuration. Creation of the app using the typescript template. The milestones completed were:

-   Installation of bootstrap, react router dom
-   Creation of the navbar with logo

##Day 2
Since the creation of a modal is more complicated than expected, the react-bootstrap library is installed

-   Installation of react bootstrap
-   Creation of modal to add new word
-   First approach to transform word to japanese

##Day 3
Another day trying to fix the function to transform words to hiragana

-   Transform word function patched with @ts-ignore
-   Test for transform word added
-   Implementation of function with the original word input

##Day 4

-   Fixed the add word button: Now it adds the word to the list, closes the modal and clean the form
